                <li>½ can Refried Beans (no fat) ((15 oz can))</li>
                <li>¼ cup McCormick's Chili Powder</li>

                <li>1 tsp Oregano</li>
                <li>1 tsp Chipotle Chili Powder ((optional))</li>
                <li>1 can Pinto Beans (los sodium) ((15oz can - drained & rinsed))</li>
                <li>1 can Kidney Beans ((50% less sodium - not drained))</li>
                <li>½ tsp Black Pepper</li>
                <li>½ tsp Garlic Powder</li>
                <li>2 Tbs Pickled Jalapeños (with juice) ((again, adds a little heat so adjust accordingly))</li>
            <li>1-2 Tbs Masa Harina Tamale Flour ((if necessary to thicken))</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop onions and peppers into a large soup pot</li>
            <li>Saute in a little veggie broth until translucent and softened.</li>
            <li>Add minced garlic and saute for an additional 30 seconds until fragrant</li>
            <li>Add any kind of meat substitute (if using) or dry, uncooked bulgur and continue to stir for a few minutes until heated through</li>
            <li>Add tomatoes, tomato sauce, and remaining broth</li>
            <li>Add in spices and stir until mixed well</li>
            <li>Add all the beans and jalapeños and stir</li>
            <li>Sprinkle up to 1-2 Tbs of the Masa on top if you think it needs thickening.  The masa adds a slight 'corn tortilla' or 'tamale' flavor to the chili. </li>
            <li>Give the chili one more good stir and bring it to a slow boil.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
