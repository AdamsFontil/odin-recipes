        <figcaption><strong>My verdit:</strong> This recipe along with the others is super easy to make. I think the only extra thing you'll need for these
            recipes are the spices. Finding quinoa may be a hassle and you may think eww quinoa but dude dude DUDE, quinoa's just like rice. I know people make it
            seem boujee and extra but it really isn't and it's better for you and in this dish it's soo good. Mexican food have the spice, and the flavor and all the
            quinoa does is soak in and absorb all of those juices. Plus this recipe has beans and corn and I freaking love those two things when they come together what can
            I say it's a <em>fiesta</em>.

        <h2>Watch her cook it</h2>
        <p>This is probably my favorite recipe. I eat rice and beans like almost everyday and this recipe doesn't really
            deviate much from what I'm used to eating. It's an elevated version of what I usually have. It's soo light but fills you up soo much.
             You can eat the whole thing and instead of wanting to take a nap you'll want to run around instead. I loved this one, it's for sure my fav,
             along with the bean burgers I made one time. If I wasn't soo lazy I'd prbably have those bean burgers every week but I can't help what I am so
             I just make rice and beans instead. Beans are great
            they're used in this recipe so this recipes fire just because of that fact alone. Also this isn't the original video that I followed, but it's close enough.</p>
