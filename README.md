# odin-recipes
In this project I plan on constructing my first website.
My recipes website will have all vegan recipes.
I like the idea of veganism and I plan on creating a list of
dishes that I think are delicious, easy to make and aren't too expensive.
I probably will try to write a little manifesto about veganism, so I'll be
making use of the <p> tag, I'll also use <strong> and <em> to bring attention to
key ideas, or concepts. The image I'll use will probably be a jpg, but speaking
of images I may use gifs, png, and the from what I've read wonderful all around svg.
I'd like to see how they each end up looking on the site.

I don't know if it's worth noting but I do intend on setting up the boilerplate without copying and pasting, or even looking at the examples provided by TOP.

Other ideas that I have for this site is to practice with organizinng this website well with folders for pictures, and pages to different recipes. I also would like to add links to maybe some vegan documentaries or something. I can use the symbol of veganism probably as a png. And maybe some gifs about animal cruelty. So maybe add an extra page about why one should become vegan. This website is for me and maybe to show to some personal friends about my thoughts on the movement and my favorite dishes I've tried and enjoyed thus far from it.
